# hc-newsletter-signup
Thank you for your interrest on my Newsletter signup WebApp.

This App showcases how I used HTML. CSS; and Bootstrap to create the front end 
of the application while on the backend I used a Client - Server API Server Architecture 
with NodeJS, and ExpressJS to connect to the the Mailchimp servers to automatically build 
a mailing list of members that request to be added to the mailing list.
